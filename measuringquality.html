<h3> Measuring the quality of MCMC output </h3>

<section>

<h5> Pitch </h5>

<p>
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are now employed in nearly all fields
of science. Along with a constant development of new methods, research on MCMC
has led to steady improvements in our theoretical understanding of these
techniques. However, most theoretical tools translate only vaguely into
guidelines for practitioners, for example regarding the tuning of parameters
and the choice of iterations to perform. How to address questions of “quality
control” for practical MCMC algorithms has seemed to attract less attention than
the development of new algorithms.
</p>

<p>
This event puts a spotlight on the question of assessing the quality of MCMC
samples. It brings together 1) people who work on the development of methods
addressing that question, and 2) people who encounter challenging sampling
problems in applications. The goal is to bridge methodology and practice, so
that methodologists can update their benchmarks and practitioners can update
their toolbox. The workshop is intended to highlight advances,
put people in touch,
share experiences, identify challenges,
and start collaborations among participants.
</p>

<h5> Dates, format, instructions </h5>
<p>
The workshop will be fully online. This website will collect relevant material,
including posters submitted by participants and a link to a YouTube channel for
pre-recorded video presentations. 
This content will be freely available and we hope that this website 
will remain a useful portal to this topic long after the workshop!
</p>

<p>
You can submit a (~20 minute) video recording of a research presentation
and/or a poster by indicating the title of these items
in the registration form and emailing the organisers with the material
preferably by <b>September 29th</b>. For videos, these materials should preferably be
an mp4 file or a YouTube link, in addition to a PDF file for slides. Poster submissions
should be PDF files.
</p>


<p>
<b>All participants are encouraged to share some material</b>, in order to facilitate interactions 
during the live sessions.  If you are too shy to
send a video or a poster, consider sharing some slides describing your
research interests in connection to the workshop topic. You can also send us a link to a
paper or to some code, and we will paste it here.
</p>

<p> The workshop event itself will be made of three live sessions on Zoom and gather.town, on different dates
and times so as to accommodate different time zones.  
Each session will each have a different theme, and will be organized roughly as:
<ul>
    <li> introductory words (a bit longer during the first session), </li>
<li>  a bunch of very short presentations advertising prerecorded talks, posters, papers etc, </li>
<li>  a discussion, structured along questions specific to each session's theme, </li>
    <li> a poster session on gather.town (open for at least 90 minutes each time) </li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
To facilitate interactivity the participants are invited to familiarize themselves with the
available material on this website beforehand. That material should start appearing here from September 29th. </p>

<p> The live sessions will be as follows.
<ul>
    <li>
        Session 1: <b> 11am-2pm UTC on Wednesday 6th October.</b>
    <br>
    <b>Theme: general view on MCMC diagnostics.</b> The first session will be an opportunity to comment on the meaning of "convergence diagnostics", review old and new methods and their limitations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Session 2:  <b>1pm-4pm UTC on Thursday 14th October.</b>
    <br>
    <b> Theme: diagnostics for specific samplers.</b> 
    Here the focus will be on modern samplers, and the specific challenges that
    they raise when it comes to convergence diagnostics. For example:
    MCMC for phylogenetic inference, piecewise-deterministic Markov processes, gradient-based MCMC.
    </li>
    <li>
        Session 3:  <b>3pm-6pm UTC on Friday 22nd October.</b>
    <br>
    <b> Theme: Theory and practice, bridging gaps, and ways forward.</b>
    The last session will be an opportunity to review emerging practical
    challenges and discuss ways forward for practitioners, methodologists, and
    theoreticians, identifying fruitful avenues of research, collaborations.
    </li> 
    </ul>
</p>


<p>
There will be a prize for best presentation or poster, awarded to a junior researcher,
selected by the advisors of the workshop listed below!
The winner (or winners) will be announced shortly after the end of the workshop.

<h5> Registration </h5>
<p> Registration is free but compulsory, 
so as to limit the number of participants to an approximate maximum of 100
(as of September 23th we count 71 registrations).
We are primarily welcoming participants whose current research aligns with the topic
of the workshop.</p>
