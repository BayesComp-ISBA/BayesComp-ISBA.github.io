<li>The name of the section: <b><font color=#0f5e9b>ISBA Section on Bayesian Computation (BayesComp)</font></b> hereafter referred to as "Section" below.</li>
</div>

<div class="box">
<li><b><font color=#0f5e9b>The purpose of the Section:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>The purposes of the Section include the promotion of original research
into computational methods for Bayesian inference and decision making,
the promotion of the use of frontier computational tools among
practitioners, and the translation and dissemination, among
statisticians, of methods developed in other disciplines.
To address these purposes, the Section will, among other activities,
organise conferences, workshops, short courses, and sessions in
other meetings, and will maintain a website of information and advice
as an authoritative central resource for Bayesian computation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</div>

<div class="box">
<li><b><font color=#0f5e9b>The offices, duties and terms of offices:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>The offices are those of Chair, Chair-elect, Program chair, Treasurer,

Secretary are elected by the membership for staggered two year terms.
The Chair-elect succeeds the office of Chair for a term of two years.</li>
